# Parking-Simulator
Unity3D Virtual Reality application which uses map data from openstreetmap.org to procedurally display streets and buildings in a 3D Virtual Reality environment.

The goal of this project was to help users to navigate to parking spaces in a region of their choice - finding parking spaces is hard and this project allows to practice this task safely in Virtual Reality.

The user is seated inside a (simple) car model and can move around via the arrow keys. 
A list of nearby parking spaces (read automatically from the map data) is displayed. If the user chooses one of these spaces, a simple compass is displayed to indicate the driving direction and distance - the task is then to navigate to the parking space.
